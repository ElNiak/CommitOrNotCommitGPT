# CommitOrNotCommitGPT

## Description

This action will generate a report indicating if the commit is valide/unsafe/unvalid in term of:
- code quality
- code style
- code security

It will uses the GPT-4 model to generate the report message.

However GPT-4 is not released yet, so now we focus on experiment with ChatGPT-4.

It should be possible for a coding project X, to use their code base as knowledge base for the GPT-4 model.

The GPT4 model should be able to use "action" toward other checker tools to improve the quality of the report.

Then the GPT-4 model will be able to generate a report for a commit of the project X.

This project aims to provide a free and open source solution for the community.
